My current goal is to finish all the FrontEnd Mentor challenges, to train and learn in the process. After finishing all HTML and CSS challenges, I will start JavaScript lessons.

### Useful resources 🎒

- [Stefan Bojkovski - Solution](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/solution-huddle-landing-page-with-curved-sections-wPIVrVe6cv) - After I finished the first time, I took a look at Stefan's solution and saw that I could still improve, so I "tweaked" my code.
